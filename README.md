# Lunar-Lander

This Lunar Lander game simulates gravity, thrust, and fuel. The player controls the lander using the spacebar to apply thrust. The goal is to land gently on the landing pad. A successful landing is determined by the velocity being below a certain threshold when touching the pad. Let me know if you'd like additional features or enhancements!
